## Introduction

**Dataset Description**

This project investigates a dataset consisting of 10,000 movies sourced from The Movie Database (TMDb). The aim is to understand the dynamics of the film industry, including factors influencing movie success and the impact of inflation on financial outcomes.

**Question(s) for Analysis**

- What is the relationship between the average budget and revenue for the top-performing movie genres?
- How have film budgets changed on average every five years?
- What are the top-performing directors in terms of total revenue, among those who have directed at least 10 movies?

## Data Wrangling

The first step in the analysis is to load and examine the dataset. We'll check for missing values and duplicate rows, examine data types, and identify potential instances of missing or erroneous data.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

This section will cover the data analysis process where we'll compute statistics and create visualizations with the goal of addressing the research questions posed in the Introduction section.

<a name="conclusions"></a>
## Conclusions

In this final section, we'll provide a summary and the conclusions of the data analysis.

## Analysis

We use the cleaned data to answer our research question. We produce at least two visualizations using the cleaned data and explain how they help us answer the question.

<a name="data-storing"></a>
## Data Storing

We update our local database/data store with the cleaned data, following best practices for storing our cleaned data:

- We maintain different instances/versions of data (raw and cleaned data).
- We name the dataset files informatively.
- We ensure both the raw and cleaned data are saved to our database/data store.
